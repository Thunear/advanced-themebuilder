The Design System should be accessible to everyone, regardless of permanent or temporary reduced abilities.

Accessibility is part of the development process from the moment we begin to specify a component until it goes into production. When we discover errors or deficiencies in a component that affect whether it is universally designed, these tasks will be prioritized by the design system team. All components must comply with [legal requirements for universal design in the public sector](https://www.uutilsynet.no/regelverk/gjeldende-regelverk-og-krav/746).

Accessible components are just one part of creating accessible solutions. We will therefore also create guides and other aids so that teams get extra support to use the components for their intended purposes.

Under [Best Practices - Accessibility](/good-practice#accessibility), we will publish articles about how we can make our solutions as accessible as possible.
