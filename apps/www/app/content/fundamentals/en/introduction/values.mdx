These are the values we want the Design System to be built upon:

## Quality

The Design System should maintain high quality and make it efficient to create digital products with good quality. By good quality, we mean something that provides a good user experience and has a solid technical foundation. All components should fulfill legal requirements, such as universal design. What we create should be [accessible](/en/fundamentals/introduction/accessibility) and provide a good user experience for everyone, regardless of permanent or temporary reduced abilities.

## Cohesiveness

The goal is for the Design System to contribute to more cohesive and consistent user experiences across the public sector. When solutions use the same building blocks at their foundation, it creates predictability for citizens. In addition to reusable components, we should help each other establish recognizable patterns across solutions. The patterns should show how to handle the most common user tasks and actions. When we use established patterns and conventions that citizens recognize across platforms, the solutions can become more intuitive and contribute to reducing digital exclusion.

## Collaboration and Openness

The Design System is based on a philosophy of collaboration, and it is desirable that it is developed in cooperation between public agencies. It should be easy for anyone to take ownership of the Design System and get involved with contributions and input. We share everything we do openly - [source code](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet), [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/1), [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=19744450), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@designsystemet), [Storybook](https://storybook.designsystemet.no), and [documentation](https://www.designsystemet.no).

What exists in the Design System is not set in stone - we want to create this together and make it work for many. All input, arguments, insights, and contributions are welcome. There should be an easy path to change if the contribution leads to better solutions.

## Design and Developer Experience

It should be easy for other developers and designers to use and implement changes in the Design System and its components. It should be simple to find components, understand what a component does, and when it should be used. If there are challenges related to a component, this should be made visible and documented. It should be easy and predictable to navigate the technical solution.

## Trust

The Design System should handle challenges and changes in a safe and good way so that it achieves high trust among users. Users of the Design System should be able to trust that components don't stop working and that they behave as expected. Users of the Design System must be able to trust that the Design System is well taken care of and updated according to new requirements and needs that arise. We aim for mutual trust - trust in contributors is also important.
