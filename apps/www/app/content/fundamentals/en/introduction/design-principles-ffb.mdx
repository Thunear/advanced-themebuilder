## Common design principles

The [Forum for User Experience](https://www.digdir.no/digitalisering-og-samordning/forum-brukskvalitet/3579) conducted a workshop where they began defining common principles among professionals working with usability and user experience in the public sector.

### Collaboration in the public sector

#### Process

- We test and investigate before we draw conclusions
- We build conclusions on insights
- We take care of everyone, including the most vulnerable (digitally excluded, those with disabilities)
- We respect and utilize our colleagues and community
- We use plain language as a process tool
- We include everyone
- Consistency is key
- We are empathetic

#### Sharing

- We share what we do
- We work openly "open source"
- We share knowledge and expertise
- We use and contribute to common design systems
- We share a learning mindset

#### Cross-agency values

- We acknowledge individual agency achievements (in shared forums, etc.)
- We don't dilute brands when they participate in "one gov" (maintain identities)
- We finance common initiatives
