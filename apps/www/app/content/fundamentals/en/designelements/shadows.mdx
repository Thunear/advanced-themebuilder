## Use of shadows in design

Shadows should be used consciously and consistently as they express that something is positioned above something else in the solution.

Shadows can help the visually impaired to identify components. The use of shadows and outlines makes it easier and faster to find a component when scanning pages. (Research: [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html#research))

### Strengths

We have different strengths of shadows, from xsmall to xlarge. The different strengths are used to suggest the height of the surface. Surfaces at higher heights have larger shadows, while those at lower heights should have smaller shadows. Shadows should create a hierarchy so that what lies above or below something else becomes more clearly visible.

## Tokens

Make sure you have light mode activated to see the shadows. Shadows are not intended for use in dark mode, as they are based on darker color tones. To create hierarchy and contrast in dark mode, it is better to use other means such as light edges.

### Example

Popover is a component that overlays other content. This is made clear by using a medium shadow.
