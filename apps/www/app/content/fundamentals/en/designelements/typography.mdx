To present text correctly, styles have been created with different combinations of size, font weight, and line height. A set of typography components has also been created that encapsulate these styles, making them easy to use in different contexts. A description of how typography components are used can be found in the component article [Typography](https://storybook.designsystemet.no/?path=/docs/komponenter-typography--docs).

## Font-family

Font-family is not part of the design system library; you must import the desired font in your app. The components have only been tested with the "Inter" font. If you choose a different font, you need to test that it looks good yourself.

Inter is a font specifically designed for good readability on computer screens. It meets the following criteria:

- [Open font license](https://github.com/rsms/inter/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) + has an [active community](https://github.com/rsms/inter)
- Large font family (light, regular, italic, bold, semibold)
- Recognizable letters, numbers, and special characters (not too creative)
- Clear ascenders and descenders on the letters
- Visible difference between similar characters (I, l, 1) (must be activated)
- Open letters don't close up (e.g., characters like a, e, and c)
- Consistent stroke thickness in transitions
- Tabular numbers ([monospace](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/understanding_numerals))
- [Variable font](https://rsms.me/inter/#variable)
- Good letter and word spacing
- Language support

The font is available in Figma without needing to download and install it yourself. If you need it for other purposes, you can download it from [github.com/rsms/inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/v3.19).

For hosting, the Altinn CDN can be used:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://altinncdn.no/fonts/inter/v4.1/inter.css"
  integrity="sha384-OcHzc/By/OPw9uJREawUCjP2inbOGKtKb4A/I2iXxmknUfog2H8Adx71tWVZRscD"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

To activate lowercase l with tail, add the following to your CSS:

```css
font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
font-feature-settings: 'cv05' 1; /* Enable lowercase l with tail */
```

## Text size

Text size variables are specified in **rem**. This value is relative to the `font-size` of the `html` element,
and is based on the most common standard where `1rem = 16px`. When we specify text size in rem, the size will be related to the browser's standard size, and thus also take into account if the user has chosen to scale up the text size under accessibility settings in their browser.

We have a total of 10 sizes in the design system: 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60px. The default text size for `paragraph` is `md`, which corresponds to 18px.

| Step   | Size               | Body\*  | Heading |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| 1      | 12px / 0.75rem     |         |         |
| 2      | 14px / 0.875rem    | xs      |         |
| **3**  | **16px / 1.00rem** | sm      |         |
| 4      | 18px / 1.125rem    | md      | 2xs     |
| 5      | 21px / 1.313rem    | lg      | xs      |
| 6      | 24px / 1.50rem     | xl      | sm      |
| 7      | 30px / 1.875rem    |         | md      |
| 8      | 36px / 2.25rem     |         | lg      |
| 9      | 48px / 3.00rem     |         | xl      |
| 10     | 60px / 3.75rem     |         | 2xl     |

\*The `Body` sizes are also used for `Ingress`, `Label`, and `ValidationMessage`.

### What about dynamic text sizes?

Dynamic font size without breakpoints was standard in the Design System for most of the Beta period. Dynamic font sizes, or "_Fluid typography_", have some disadvantages that made us choose a static font scale instead.

**Read more about [Fluid typography, and why we moved away from it](/blog/2024/fluid-typography)**.

## Line length

For the best possible readability for all users, there should be no more than 65-70 characters per line including spaces. This makes the text more inviting and less overwhelming, and is particularly important for users with reading or concentration difficulties. _Source: [uutilsynet.no](https://www.uutilsynet.no/veiledning/tekst-og-struktur/226)_

## Spacing and whitespace

You must choose the whitespace you want between text elements yourself. You can do this by using tokens for `spacing`.

### Suggested spacing
Here is a suggestion for spacing to achieve suitable rhythm and whitespace between elements:

`size-6` below `Heading-xl` \
`size-5` below `Heading-lg` \
`size-4` below `Heading-md` \
`size-3` below `Heading-sm` 

<br/>

`size-5` between `body-md` \
`size-4` between `body-sm`

<br/>

`size-10` above all headings/chapters
