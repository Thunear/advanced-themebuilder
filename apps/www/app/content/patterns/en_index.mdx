## Common patterns

If we can establish common patterns, it becomes easier for a user who has done something in one place to recognize and understand how to do it elsewhere. This way, we can help include more people digitally. It is also one of the measures in the "[Action Plan for Increased Inclusion in a Digital Society, measure 26](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/handlingsplan-for-auka-inkludering-i-eit-digitalt-samfunn/id2984233/)", which states that we should work towards more similar interaction patterns across services.

Common patterns can, for example, contribute to:

- Interaction and behavior of elements becoming recognizable across services.
- Placement of key elements meeting user expectations.
- Recurring user tasks being experienced as familiar.

In the report "[Digital throughout life with better user experience](https://www.digdir.no/sammenhengende-tjenester/digital-hele-livet-med-bedre-brukeropplevelse/4405)", several [concrete usability problems](https://github.com/digdir/innsiktsbibliotek/issues/3) have been identified that can be improved if we collaborate on establishing similar patterns across public services. We can collaborate on patterns even if we don't use the same technical components or design elements.

## Cross-agency collaboration

To establish common patterns across services, the design system teams from **Digdir, Nav, Norwegian Tax Administration, Brønnøysund Register Centre, and Oslo Municipality**, among others, have formed a cross-agency working group to develop common guidelines for interaction patterns.

We gather insights from our own organizations, review them, identify differences, and arrive at a common approach through regular work meetings.

The patterns established through this collaboration are published as articles:

- [Required and optional form fields](required-and-optional-fields)
- [User-triggered error messages](errors)
- [System notifications](systemnotifications)

## Planned patterns

The patterns that need to be addressed across agencies are documented in [this overview on Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/samarbeid-m%C3%B8nster-for-innbyggertjenester). The main group for pattern collaboration prioritizes which patterns to work on and initiates working groups. If you have suggestions for other patterns, you are welcome to [create a new discussion thread](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/new?category=samarbeid-m%C3%B8nster-for-innbyggertjenester). We also appreciate all insights shared in the various topic threads for each pattern.

## Join the collaboration

Anyone who wishes can influence the work through open discussions on [Slack](https://www.designsystemet.no/slack) and [Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/categories/samarbeid-m%C3%B8nster-for-innbyggertjenester). If you want to be more closely involved in the collaboration, we also have room for more participants in the working groups. [Contact us (email)](mailto:designsystem@digdir.no)!
