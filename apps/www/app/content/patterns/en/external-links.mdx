## How to mark and use external links?
This pattern is being developed in a cross-agency working group during spring 2025. You can influence the pattern and share your insights on [Github](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/discussions/2294).

**The working group will look at**
- How we should mark external links. Either by using visual indicators such as icons, text descriptions, or other means.
- How we ensure that external links are accessible to all users.
- Language - How we write link texts.
- How we communicate that something opens in a new tab/window, and in which cases this is appropriate.
- How we mark files that can be downloaded.
- How we mark telephone and email links, as well as other links that open applications.
