Kristian Birkeli, a bachelor student in Computer Science at UiS, has during the spring semester of 2024 completed a bachelor thesis in collaboration with Digdir and the Design System.

In his thesis, Birkeli has explored how it can become easier to adopt and use the Design System. He has conducted a series of interviews with users and potential users of the Design System. Through these interviews, we have gained insight into what is currently challenging about adopting the Design System, as well as the expectations of potential users.

## Theme Builder

Part of the project has been to explore and prototype a "Theme Builder" with a graphical user interface that makes it easier to see how components from the Design System can be adapted to individual sender identities. The Theme Builder also had the ability to export selected values to CSS to make it easier to get started with using the design system.

By using the tool, users can see the components from the design system with their own colors with just a few clicks.

## User Tests and Further Work

User testing of the prototype has also been an important part of the bachelor project. The user tests, which have been conducted with six designers and developers, have given us valuable insights into what it takes to make the design system easier to adopt.

Digdir has already taken the insights further in their work to improve the token structure and color system. Through the user tests, it emerged that the existing color system was difficult to understand. The `Action` color only affected the `Button` component, but it was expected to function as an `accent` color that affected multiple form elements. Based on these insights, Digdir has further explored a completely new color system and token structure that will support theming further.

The insights also showed that users expected the tool to automatically maintain contrast requirements. We therefore worked further on a color system that is based on the organization's brand color, while ensuring that colors intended for text always have sufficient contrast against colors intended for backgrounds, both for light and dark mode.

## We thank you for the collaboration

We thank Birkeli for a very good collaboration through weekly meetings. The prototype Birkeli has developed, and the insights gathered, are extremely important contributions that make us better equipped to establish a color system and token structure that is more flexible, easier to understand, and still maintains contrast requirements. The Design System team will continue to create a theme builder for the Design System based on the work Birkeli has started.
