The Design System is removing `HelpText`, which means it won't be included in version 1.
Why are we doing this? And what should you do if you're still using it?

At the bottom of this article, you'll find code to implement this component yourself.

## Why are we removing `HelpText`?

It has been a challenging component to recommend consistently, and several factors indicate that it doesn't fit in the Design System:

- **Easy to implement yourself:** `HelpText` is essentially a popover attached to a button, which can easily be created with a short CSS snippet and existing components.
- **Unclear use case:** We don't have clear recommendations for when and how help text should be displayed, so the component can easily be misused.
- **Uncommon in design systems:** Few design systems include a dedicated `HelpText` component, precisely because help text varies greatly in form and context.
- **Limits flexibility:** Offering `HelpText` as a standard popover creates expectations that help text should always be displayed this way. There are several solutions better suited for different situations.

## What should you do if you're still using it?

If you've been using `HelpText`, you'll find a code snippet at the bottom of this article showing how you can implement the functionality yourself.
This solution gives you the freedom to customize help text according to your needs.

## Further work

We're working on clarifying when and how help text should be integrated into interfaces, and look forward to offering more precise recommendations in the future.
A pattern for different types of help text will eventually be developed.

## Code

You can use the code below to compose your own `HelpText` component.
The CSS snippet includes an icon; the class should be added to `Popover.Trigger`.

### CSS

```css
.ds-helptext {
  --dsc-helptext-icon-size: 65%;
  --dsc-helptext-icon-url: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' fill='none' viewBox='0 0 8 14'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23000' fill-rule='evenodd' d='M4 11a1.5 1.5 0 1 1 0 3 1.5 1.5 0 0 1 0-3ZM4 0c2.2 0 4 1.66 4 3.7 0 .98-.42 1.9-1.17 2.6l-.6.54-.29.29c-.48.46-.87.93-.94 1.41V9.5H3v-.81c0-1.26.84-2.22 1.68-3L5.42 5C5.8 4.65 6 4.2 6 3.7 6 2.66 5.1 1.83 4 1.83c-1.06 0-1.92.75-2 1.7v.15H0C0 1.66 1.8 0 4 0Z' clip-rule='evenodd'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
  --dsc-helptext-size: var(--ds-size-7);

  border-radius: var(--ds-border-radius-full);
  border: max(1px, calc(var(--ds-size-1) / 2)) solid; /* Allow border-width to grow with font-size */
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: var(--dsc-helptext-size);
  min-height: 0;
  min-width: 0;
  padding: 0;
  position: relative;
  width: var(--dsc-helptext-size);

  @media (forced-colors: active) {
    color: ButtonText;
  }

  &::before {
    content: '';
    border-radius: inherit;
    background: currentcolor;
    mask-composite: exclude;
    mask-image: var(--dsc-helptext-icon-url);
    mask-position: center;
    mask-repeat: no-repeat;
    mask-size: var(--dsc-helptext-icon-size) var(--dsc-helptext-icon-size), cover;
    scale: 1.1; /* Hide tiny half pixel rendeing bug */
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;

    @media (forced-colors: active) {
      background: ButtonText;
    }
  }

  &:has(+ :popover-open)::before {
    mask-image: var(--dsc-helptext-icon-url), linear-gradient(currentcolor, currentcolor); /* Cut icon out of currentcolor surface */
  }

  @media print {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Markup

```tsx
export type HelpTextProps = {
  /**
   * Required descriptive label for screen readers.
   **/
  "aria-label": string;
  /**
   * Placement of the Popover.
   * @default 'right'
   */
  placement?: "right" | "bottom" | "left" | "top";
} & Omit<ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, "color">;

export const HelpText = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, HelpTextProps>(
  function HelpText(
    { placement = "right", children, ...rest },
    ref
  ) {
    return (
      <Popover.TriggerContext>
        <Popover.Trigger
          className="ds-helptext"
          ref={ref}
          variant="tertiary"
          data-color="info"
          {...rest}
        />
        <Popover placement={placement} data-color="info">
          {children}
        </Popover>
      </Popover.TriggerContext>
    );
  }
);
```
