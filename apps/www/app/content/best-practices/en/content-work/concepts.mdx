In Digdir, we are two content designers who cover many products and teams. To raise awareness about language, content design, and microtexts in teams, we conduct courses on various topics related to creating good content.

We have also started working on standardizing certain language elements across the board. We do this so that people in product teams don't have to wonder what to write on a button or in a component.

This article provides recommendations for common names on buttons and navigation elements. We launched these in Digdir before summer, and they were well received. People have been wondering about this! We hope these recommendations can be useful for others out there.

### How did we approach this?

We have researched and compared what other organizations use, where possible. We have also checked definitions in both Norwegian and English. With these recommendations, we hope that buttons and navigation elements can be consistent across multiple products and services.

We welcome suggestions for other concepts that might be useful to agree upon, so that those creating public digital services can provide users with consistent content elements from one place to another—just as they get consistent components.

### These are the concepts we have created recommendations for

| Word | We recommend |
|---|---|
| Delete/Remove | We recommend using "Delete" as the button name everywhere. This is to avoid having two terms for the same action. If we need to clarify that something "will be permanently gone," we can either provide a warning or write "Delete permanently" on the button. We have decided not to use "Remove." We don't need two terms for the same action. |
| Next/Previous | We recommend "Next" and "Previous" on buttons in English. |
| Continue/Go back<br />Go to (for example inbox)<br />To (inbox) | Can be used for breadcrumbs/nav links.<br />This way we distinguish between the next step in the flow and the action of "browsing through a lot of information." |
| Change/Edit | We recommend "Change." It's short and familiar to everyone. |
| Close | We recommend "Close" as the text for closing modals, if something more than an x-symbol/icon is needed. |
| Show/Hide | We recommend "Show" and "Hide" as text in, for example, accordions/dropdowns. Many just use the chevron symbol (^) or down and up arrows.<br />In lists with a lot of text, where parts of the introduction are shown, we can consider "Show more" and "Show less." Most relevant on websites. |

### Provide context for screen readers

In some contexts, we should provide context to clarify what is being deleted, closed, or changed. For example, "Delete application," "Close product overview," "Change profile picture." When we don't show context, but only verbs, context should be described in `aria-label` for screen readers.
