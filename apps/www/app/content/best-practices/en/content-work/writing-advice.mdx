The components in the design system need to be filled with information for users. When we do this, it's important that we write in clear and correct language that is adapted to the target audience. Users should find, understand, and do what they came to the service to do.

Here you'll get some general advice on plain language, and links to more information if you want to read more about how to write clearly and concisely. Additionally, there is advice on language in the guidelines for the individual components in the design system.

## Test on real users

The most important thing you can do to ensure that users understand what you write is to conduct user testing. Test early and frequently, and test on real users. Test words and concepts. Use real text when testing both early sketches and prototypes.

## How to write concisely and clearly

Advice on how to write clearly and plainly is often also advice on how to write concisely. Make it clear who is doing what. Think of it as writing a conversation. In addition, it's important to write concretely, place verbs early in sentences, and avoid unnecessary nouns.

### Who does what must be clearly stated

In digital services, it's important that users easily understand who should do what. Regulations and laws often use passive language, which has also characterized public language in general. When we write passively, it becomes unclear who is doing what.

Therefore, we should write actively and as if we are speaking directly to the user. We should use words like "you" and "we."

#### Example

**Don't write:** An email will be sent when the application has been processed. \
**Instead write:** You will receive an email from us when your application has been processed.

### Avoid nominalization

When we use many nouns, the text becomes heavy to read and we use more words than necessary. This is especially true when we turn a verb into a noun, for example, when we choose to write "conduct an investigation" instead of "investigate." You can check if the text is nominalized by looking for words that end in "-tion," "-ment," etc., and have "of" in front of them.

#### Example

**Don't write:** We have conducted a processing of the application \
**Instead write:** We have processed the application

### Place the verb as early as possible in the sentence

When language becomes formal, we often place the verb too far into the sentence. This means you have to read many words before you get to the verb, making it harder to remember what was at the beginning of the sentence.

#### Example

**Don't write:** The employee has certain obligations that must be fulfilled \
**Instead write:** The employee must fulfill certain obligations
