When we visit a website or use an app, we scan for something that can catch our attention, a hint or tip about what's important, what we should do, or whether we can find answers to our questions in a paragraph.

We need to take this reading style into account when creating content. Additionally, we must consider users' reading abilities. Adults in Norway generally have good reading skills, but many find the language in public digital services difficult to understand. This may be because they don't have Norwegian as their native language, have cognitive difficulties, or weak reading skills for other reasons. Furthermore, many with good reading skills find the language difficult because of unfamiliar words, concepts, and themes.

When we have good content structure and use clear language and words that people recognize, it becomes easier to both scan and comprehend the content. This applies also to those with weak reading skills.

## How to write texts that are easy to skim read

1. **Use bullet points for lists**

   - Maximum one sentence per point, preferably just a few words.

2. **Use short words**

   - Choose simple and short words instead of formal or long words.
   - Use the words that users use.
   - Avoid jargon, outdated words, and trendy terms.

3. **Avoid long sentences**

   - One point in each sentence.
   - Avoid more than 15 words in a sentence.

4. **One topic in each paragraph**

   - Have a maximum of 3-4 sentences per paragraph.

5. **Create meaningful headings and subheadings**

Headings and subheadings should reflect the content of the paragraph. They should preferably be a complete sentence.

- Headings function as signposts in the text and make it easier to scan and read.
- Subheadings should connect narratively so that users understand the most important points by just reading them.
- Put the most important words first.

6. **Don't use capital letters, italics, and bold text**

7. **Write in plain language**
