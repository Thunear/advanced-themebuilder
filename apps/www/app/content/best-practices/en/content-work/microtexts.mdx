Microtexts are the small texts in the graphical user interface (GUI) of a product or service, such as labels, button names, and messages. Because we have received questions about periods and other punctuation marks in such texts from developers and designers, we have formulated some guidelines for this.

We can get far by following the standard rules for punctuation in English, but here is a clarification for different types of components.

Note: Plain web pages are not included here, they follow general punctuation rules for English.

## Titles

Titles and headings should not have periods according to punctuation rules. In some cases, we use exclamation marks, for example on a front page where we write "Welcome!" However, we recommend avoiding exclamation marks in titles if possible. Instead, formulate a complete sentence: "Welcome to the security seminar".

### Introduction under titles

An introduction can consist of one or more sentences. It therefore follows standard punctuation rules and should have a period.

## Labels
Labels should never have periods, nor colons or exclamation marks.
If the label is formulated as a question, which can be the case in a form, it should have a question mark. Note that labels should always have a capital letter in the first word.

### Descriptions under labels
Often we have a description under a label to help users quickly understand what to do. This text is considered one or more regular sentences and should have a period.

### Help texts

Help texts are those texts that we often hide under an i or a ? in the interface. They are now often replaced with a description that is visible all the time. If we still use help text, we consider it as regular sentences and they should have periods.

## Messages

We write info messages, validation messages, and error messages with periods. A rule of thumb to determine if you should use a period is to consider whether there could be more than one sentence here. If yes, use a period.

## Buttons

Button names should never have periods.

## Accordions

We do not use periods in the introductory text of an accordion. It is considered a heading. The text that follows adheres to standard punctuation rules for sentences/paragraphs and should have periods.
