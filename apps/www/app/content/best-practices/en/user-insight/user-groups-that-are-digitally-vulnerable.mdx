In the report [Digital throughout life with better user experience](https://www.digdir.no/sammenhengende-tjenester/digital-hele-livet-med-bedre-brukeropplevelse/4405), we have described six user groups that are digitally vulnerable. If we create services that meet the needs of these groups, we also make it easier for everyone else to use digital services.

The user groups are described as personas that can be used as a tool in the development of digital services. Personas are fictional descriptions of people who represent the user groups. They are not a complete picture or an exhaustive list of needs and life situations, but a simplification of reality. A citizen may belong to multiple groups simultaneously or move in and out of user groups.

## User groups face different barriers to digital participation

In the descriptions of the personas, you can also read about the barriers to digital participation that different groups face. There are several different barriers that cause people to be excluded, and many are affected by multiple barriers. Some are excluded because they don't have enough knowledge about public administration. Others have weak language skills, and therefore cannot find, understand, and use information about rights and obligations.
Others are hindered by health and life situations, and lack a network that can help them. In addition, motivation to solve digital tasks is influenced by belief in mastery and self-confidence. Finally, some are hindered by not having access to the internet and equipment such as computers.

## 1. Gerda and Kåre - elderly couple where one must take over everything

Gerda and Kåre represent those over 65 years. This is a very large group, so there are of course major differences within the group.

Kåre and Gerda have been married for many years and are now retirees. Gerda has always taken responsibility for finances and digital tasks, but can no longer do so after a stroke. This means that Kåre must take over these tasks. But how will he manage that?

## 2. Kim - young person facing administration for the first time

Kim represents young people between 16-24 years who have middle school as their highest completed education.

Kim grew up in an unstable home and received little support from his parents. Now he has moved to a new place and become unemployed. Therefore, he needs help from the public sector, but has little knowledge about what rights he has.

## 3. Amina - immigrant and excluded in all ways

Amina represents non-Western immigrant women with weak Norwegian language skills.

Amina has a job that requires her to gain more digital competence, so she signs up for a course. Among other things, she needs help bringing her husband to Norway and understanding information from NAV.

## 4. Alex - on benefits, alone and skeptical

Alex represents those who are outside the workforce.

Alex was put on sick leave after a work accident, and the injury has weakened his concentration and memory. He has had little contact with the public sector and has not had a job that required digital competence.

## 5. Agne - the helper who cannot help

Agne represents relatives who want to help family members or friends who cannot solve digital tasks on their own.

Agne has to help her mother with digital tasks, and has therefore used her mother's BankID. When the bank finds out, they block the BankID. The alternative is to become a guardian, but Agne's mother doesn't need that.
