Drawing up experiences and touchpoints provides an overview and the opportunity to see the relationship between how services are built up from which touchpoints and how this meets or doesn't meet the citizen's situation and needs from A to Z.

## Exercise

Based on the persona, this exercise involves mapping out a user journey for the different characters interacting with the organization, before-during-after. The user journey should provide an overview of what happens/what situation the citizen is in, which touchpoints they encounter when, and what their experiences are at each touchpoint and step in the journey.

### Personas

You can base this exercise on [the typical user groups](lenke-brukergrupper) or on your own personas.

### Possible products

- User journey setup/template: Setup/template for drawing up experiences, touchpoints, and evaluations of what works well and what doesn't. For those who don't have the ability to print large sheets, tiles of e.g., A4 sheets can be assembled.
- Reflection questions: For example, evaluating experiences on a scale from sad face to smiley face, developing suggestions for adjustments to the user journey to better meet needs.
