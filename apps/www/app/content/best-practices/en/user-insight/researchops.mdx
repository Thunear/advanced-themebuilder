In an increasingly complex digital world, it is crucial to understand users' needs and behavior to develop services that meet their expectations. This is where _ResearchOps_ comes into the picture as a fundamental practice for structuring and scaling user insight work.

In this article, we will present three articles from the ReOps+ community, as well as give you three tips for getting started with ResearchOps and principles for best practice.

## Three tips for getting started with ResearchOps
These tips come from the article [How to get started with ResearchOps](https://uxnorge.no/kom-i-gang-med-researchops/)

1. **Map the maturity level in the organization** \
It is important to understand how mature the organization is when it comes to insight work. Use models such as the "Design Research Maturity Model" to evaluate the current level and identify what needs to be improved to reach the next level. This provides a realistic picture of what is achievable and what steps should be taken further. Consider all the points in the model where green represents what you already do, yellow is areas you are working on, and red is what you do not have.

2. **Create a structure and process for Scope** \
The scope pillar is often a good starting point for ResearchOps. Consider how employees work with insight work, and whether there is consistency between processes, methods, and implementation of findings from studies. Create standard templates and guidelines that can help inexperienced insight workers avoid typical pitfalls. Ensure that all documents and resources are easily accessible and simple to use.

3. **Build a solid user recruitment team** \
Recruitment and administration of participants takes a lot of time and resources. A dedicated recruitment team that understands the needs of insight work can significantly streamline this process. The team should handle the entire process from selection and screening to planning and payment to participants, and ensure good communication throughout the process.

## Principles for best practice

- **Think beyond design:** ResearchOps is not just about designers, but about everyone who works with user insight. It can be a link between different roles in the organization and help to professionalize the use of knowledge across departments and strategic levels. This underscores the importance of ResearchOps including a wide range of professionals, not just designers or insight workers.

- **Consider insight levels:** It is important to think carefully about what types of insight are needed and why. A good approach to targeted insight work should include both tactical and operational insight, as well as exploratory and strategic insight. Building a Research team that can lead this effort and using tools such as the "Research Funnel" can help structure insight work at different levels.

- **Share and make the insight useful:** Document all insight thoroughly and share it with relevant stakeholders. Ensure that the information is useful and has a concrete impact. Map the effect of the insight to ensure that it is used effectively across the organization and contributes to achieving common goals.
