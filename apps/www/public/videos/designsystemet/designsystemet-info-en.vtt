00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker1>Creating digital services requires a number of different

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker1>components. These components may look simple,

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker1>but it takes a lot of time to develop,

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker1>test and maintain a robust and scalable system.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker1>The components should work on both different devices,

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker1>screen sizes and with various accessibility aids .

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker1>Nailing all the accessibility details takes time from

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker1>product development that you could spend on more unique

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker1>issues. Fortunately, we do not need to make these

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker1>components several times.

11
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker1>They can be created once centrally and put to use in

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker1>various services, websites and applications.

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker1>Building on top of the design system's components will

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker1>save you time and money, allowing you to make better

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker1>products faster.

16
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker1>The building blocks are ready for use.

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker1>They can be customized and assembled as needed.

18
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker1>To bring out your own sender identity,

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker1>you can use your own theme.

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker1>You can get help setting up themes in the design system's

21
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker1>theme builder, which ensures good contrast between text

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker1>color and background color.

23
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker1>When the same components of the

24
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker1>patterns are applied across,

25
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker1>we create recognizability in

26
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker1>the services. This will make it easier for everyone to get

27
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker1>what they need. If users understand how something works in

28
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.766
<v Speaker1>a service, such as filling out a form,

29
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker1>it is best that the next form that meets them works the

30
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker1>same way. On designsystemet.no you will find what you need

31
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker1>to get started. D o you want to join the collaboration?

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker1>The design system is under development across several

33
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker1>actors, and it is already in use in many different

34
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker1>solutions. We also work to establish common patterns

35
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker1>across in collaboration with others.

36
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker1>Get in touch if your organization wants to participate in

37
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker1>the development or collaborate on patterns.
